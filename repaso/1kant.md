# Remember where we are

Let me refresh a bit where we are in the course.

1. We discussed utilitarianism during the first unit.
2. We moved past it.
3. Now, we're shifting focus—from consequences to principles.
4. Principles and values like justice, autonomy, freedom, and others.

When discussing principles, we delve into the realm of deontology. Among the most familiar forms of deontology are those that starkly contrast with consequentialism. These forms assert that certain choices cannot be justified solely by their outcomes—no matter how morally positive the consequences may be, some actions remain morally impermissible. Deontologists defend the notion that a choice is right, only if it aligns with a moral norm. This perspective emphasizes adherence to ethical rules over the evaluation of individual outcomes. Kant made the classic defense and the formulation of deontological ethics. 


## Kant’s moral theory: 

Immanuel Kant thought deeply about how we should behave morally. Kant's ethical theory has it basis
in the so called **Categorical Imperative**.


### The categorical imperative

The Categorical Imperative tells us to act in ways that follow rules which could apply to everyone, not just 
our situation. Imagine you're at a party and someone asks you to do something—like passing out drinks or 
cleaning up. If you decide to pass out drinks because "that's what you always do," you might be acting based 
on a habit, not the right thing to do.

In this kind of situation, we should ask: **"Can this rule apply to everyone?"** For example:

- If you're supposed to help your classmates with homework but don't want to because it feels unfair. Think 
  what the outmost rational being would do in that situation.

This approach emphasizes **moral duty** rather than just the outcome of actions. It’s not about whether your 
action is good or bad but whether it follows a rule that everyone could and should follow.


### John Rawls as a follow up

John Rawls expanded on Kant's ideas in his book *A Theory of Justice*. He introduced something called 
the **Lexicographical Ordering**, which helps us decide how to balance different moral principles when they 
conflict. Rawls' first principle of justice states that basic liberty is not to be sacrificed for other 
objectives, including wealth. His second principle of justice suggests that even a minute decrease in the 
well-being of the least prosperous classes should not be accepted in exchange for an increase, no matter
how large, in the well-being of more well-to-do citizens.

 - If you're a teacher, you might want fairness (Kant’s rule) but also need to consider helping students 
   who are struggling (Rawls’ idea of maximizing fairness).


### Example: A Teacher's Moral Decision

Imagine you’re a teacher faced with two ethical dilemmas:
 1. You want to give extra credit to students who participated in an after-school club because it’s fair.
 2. You also want to help students who are struggling academically, even if they didn’t join the club.
